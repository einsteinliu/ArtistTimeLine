#Introduction#
Terenzio Terenzi (1575â€“1621) was an Italian painter of the late-Renaissance or Mannerist period. Born near Pesaro, he is also known as Terenzio da Urbino or il Rondolino. He was a pupil of the painter Federigo Barocci. There is an altarpiece by Terenzi in the Cathedral of Sant'Andrea, a Baptism of Constantine in the quadreria di San Costanzo,[1] and an Assumption of the Virgin (1621) in the church of the Cappuccini in Rome.[2] According to Baglione, Terenzi visited Rome, where he was favored with the protection of Cardinal Montalto, nephew of Pope Sixtus V. Having practiced a deceptions on his benefactor by imposing on him a picture painted by himself for a work of Raphael, he was disgraced.[3] There is a picture of his own composition in the church of San Silvestro, in Rome, representing the Virgin and Infant Christ, with several Saints.
