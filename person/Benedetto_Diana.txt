#Introduction#
Benedetto Diana (died 1525) was an Italian Renaissance painter, a companion of Vittore Carpaccio and Giovanni di Niccolò Mansueti, who lived in the latter part of the 15th and early part of the 16th centuries. No date can be given of his birth.

He was an inferior artist, and worked both in tempera and oils. He painted The Brethren distributing Alms, in San Giovanni Evangelista, Venice, and he assisted Lazzaro Bastiani in painting the standards on the Piazza of San Marco. Many galleries in Venice possess paintings by him. In the Gallerie dell'Accademia, besides other paintings, are the Virgin and Child, formerly in Santa Lucia at Padua, and a Transfiguration. The church of Santa Maria della Croce, Crema, has an altar-piece representing the Gift of the Miraculous Girdle to St. Thomas.
