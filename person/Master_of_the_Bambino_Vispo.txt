#Introduction#
The Master of the Bambino Vispo was an Italian painter active in the early 15th century.

In the early 20th century, the art historian Osvald Sirén identified a group of unsigned paintings as being by the same artist. Sirén designated the artist as the Master of the Bambino Vispo (Master of the Lively Child) due to the unusually lively expression and movement of baby Jesus in these paintings. The paintings Sirén wrote about are:

Pietro di Domenico da Montepulciano (active 1418-1422), Parri Spinelli (1387-ca. 1453), Miguel Alcanyis (active 1408-1447) and Gherardo Starnina (1354–1403) have each been credited with this body of paintings at one time or another. The preponderance of scholarly opinion currently favors Gherardo Starnina, who worked in Spain and then in Florence in the late 14th century.
