#Introduction#
Bartolom[m]eo di Giovanni, also known as Alunno di Domenico for his relation to his master Domenico Ghirlandaio, was an early Renaissance Italian painter of the Florentine School who was active from about 1488 until his death in 1501. He studied with and assisted Domenico Ghirlandaio, painting the predella of Ghirlandaio's Adoration of the Magi in the Ospedale degli Innocenti, the foundling hospital in Florence, in 1488. Bartolomeo di Giovanni also worked under the guidance of Sandro Botticelli.

This painter should not be confused with either the Italian sculptor and architect, Bartolomeo di Giovanni d'Astore Sinibaldi (1469â€“1535), or with the Italian painter and architect, Bartolommeo di Giovanni Corradini (active mid-15th century).

There is a devotional painting by this Renaissance painter in the Art Gallery of Ontario in Toronto
