#Introduction#
Vincenzo di Stefano da Verona (also called Vincenzo da Verona) was an Italian painter of the early-Renaissance. He was probably the son of Stefano da Verona, flourished in the second half of the 15th century, and is the reputed master of Liberale da Verona. A fresco at Verona is attributed to him. It forms part of the decoration on the monument erected in 1432 at Sant' Anastasia to the memory of Cortes√≠a Serego, the general Antonio Scaliger.
