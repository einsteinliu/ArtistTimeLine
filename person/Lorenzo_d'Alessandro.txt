#Introduction#
Lorenzo d’Alessandro, also known as Lorenzo da San Severino, (San Severino Marche c1455–1503) was an Italian painter and interpreter of late gothic style. Some also refer to him as Lorenzo Salimbeni.

The artistic heritage of the school salimbenian inherited his style from Salimbeni brothers and influenced another important local painter, Niccolò Di Liberatore, also known as “L'Alunno” (from Foligno, who lived two years in San Severino and painted there a polyptych signed in 1468). Lorenzo was also inspired by Carlo Crivelli and Piero della Francesca. D’Alessandro blended the typical elements of the late Gothic culture and of the Renaissance in his expressive style. Among his pupils is Bernardino di Mariotto of Perugia.[1]

In spite of his great artistic production the majority of his paintings are scattered through both Marche and many important museums in all the world,[2][3] with only three valuable paintings being displayed in the Civic Pinacotheca of San Severino: the Virgin Mary in throne with the Child among Saints John Baptist and Agostino, the Pietà [4] the Nativity. In Saint Mary of Majesty church in Parolito, a town very close to San Severino, are conserved five frescoes ascribed to D’Alessandro.

Along with Lorenzo’s brother Jacopo, they painted frescoes of John the Baptist in Urbino. He painted an altarpiece of Madonna and child with St. Catherine receiving ring and St Domenic and glory of angels for the church of Santa Lucia in Fabriano, now displayed in the National Gallery of London.[5]
