#Introduction#
Francesco Traballesi was an Italian painter and architect. He was born in Florence in 1541, flourished in Rome in the papacy of Gregory XIII (1572â€“1585), and died in 1588 in Mantova, where he was working as an architect for the duke Vincenzo Gonzaga. In the Roman church of Sant'Atanasio dei Greci, which was founded by that pope, are two altar-pieces by this painter, an Annunciation, and a Christ disputing with the Doctors, while in the Greek College, near to the church, are other paintings by this artist, with Apostles, Fathers of the Church, and a Crucifixion, which once were parts of the iconostasis of the church itself. In the Town Hall of Tivoli, the ancient Tibur in Latium, are two frescoes by Traballesi (1574), with scenes of The mythic foundation of Tibur. His brother Bartolommeo Traballesi was an assistant of Vasari.
