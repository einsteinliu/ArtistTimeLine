#Introduction#
Orlando Flacco or Fiacco, a native of Verona, was a painter who flourished about 1560. He was instructed by Francesco Torbido, called Il Moro. His style much resembles that of Badile. Vasari praises his portraits, and Lanzi says that his forms resemble those of Caravaggio. He painted a Crucifixion and an Ecce Homo in Santi Nazaro e Celso in Verona.
