Michele Alberti was an Italian painter of the latter half of the 16th century. He trained in Florence, where he was a pupil of Daniele da Volterra. His most famous paintings are Murder of the Innocents at the church of Trinit√† dei Monti. He painted the vaults of the Conservators' Apartment representing the Murder of the Innocents much spoiled by restoration. Michele Alberti has been erroneously recorded as a member of the family of Durante Alberti of Borgo San Sepolcro.
