#Introduction#
Marco Pino or Marco da Siena (1521â€“1583) was an Italian painter of the Renaissance and Mannerist period. Born and first trained in Siena, he later worked in Rome and in Naples, where he died. He was putatively a pupil of the painters Beccafumi and Daniele da Volterra. The biographer Filippo Baldinucci also says he worked for Baldassare Peruzzi.
