#Introduction#
Domenico Alfani (c. 1479-1480 – c. 1553) was an Italian painter of the Renaissance period, active chiefly in his native Perugia.

He was a contemporary of Raphael, with whom he studied in the school of Pietro Perugino. The two artists lived on terms of intimate friendship, and the influence of the more distinguished of the two is so clearly traceable in the works of the other that these have frequently been attributed to Raphael. Towards the close of his life Alfani gradually changed his style and approximated to that of the later Florentine school. The date of his death, according to some, was 1540, while others say he was alive in 1553. Pictures by Alfani may be seen in collections at Florence and in several churches in Perugia. [1]

His son, Orazio Alfani, was also a prominent painter in Perugia, and founder of the academy of painting in that city.
