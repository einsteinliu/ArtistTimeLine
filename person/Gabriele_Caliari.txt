#Introduction#
Gabriele Caliari (1568â€“1631) was an Italian of the late-Renaissance period. He was the eldest son of Paolo Veronese, was born in 1568, and died of the plague. After training in the workshop of his father, he seems to have painted few pictures of his own, and devoted himself chiefly to commerce.
