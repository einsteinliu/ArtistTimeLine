#Introduction#
Domenico Morone (c. 1442 â€“ 1518) was an Italian painter from Verona, painting in an early Renaissance style.

Domenico Morone is known from a few panels, mainly depicting public festivals or tournaments, in which the figures in the crowds are small. One of his masterpieces is the canvas celebrating the Cacciata dei Bonacolsi (1494) (or Expulsion of the Bonacolsi in 1328, scene of Piazza Sordello, Mantua) in the Ducal Palace of Mantua. He is also known to have painted a Madonna for the organ shutters for the church of San Bernardino, now in Staatliche Museum of Berlin. He frescoed the Chapel of Sant' Antonio in this latter church. Two small panels depicting the Rape of Sabine women are attributed to Morone and are found in National Gallery of Art in London. He was considered by Vasari to be second only to Liberale da Verona among artists in his town. His son Francesco Morone was also a prominent Veronese painter. Among his pupils was Michele da Verona and Girolamo dai Libri. Morone also directed the painting of the library of the franciscan library in the church of San Bernardino, and is attributed to have complete much of the central fresco narrative.
