#Introduction#
Giovanni Battista da Ponte (1533â€“1613) was an Italian painter of the Renaissance period, active in Venice and his native Bassano del Grappa. He was the second son of Jacopo da Ponte. He was chiefly known as a copyist of his father's works. Many of his productions now figure, no doubt, under Jacopo's name. Also known as Giovanni Battista Bassano.
