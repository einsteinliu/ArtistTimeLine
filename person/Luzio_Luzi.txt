#Introduction#
Luzio Luzi (sometimes Luzzi or Luci), also known as Luzio Luzi da Todi and Luzio Romano (died late 16th century), was an Italian painter of the Late Renaissance/Mannerism era. He was born in Todi, and worked mainly as an assistant to Perino del Vaga and Daniele da Volterra.

He was mentioned by Giorgio Vasari in his Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects as one of Perino del Vaga's most important assistants, specialising in grotteschi and stucchi. He worked with del Vaga in Castel San Angelo, Rome, and in Palazzo Doria, Genoa. When Perino died on 19 October 1547, Luzi began working with another Tuscan painter, Daniele da Volterra, assisting him in the Vatican.
