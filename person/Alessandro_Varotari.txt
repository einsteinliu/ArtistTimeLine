#Introduction#
Alessandro Varotari (4 April 1588 – 20 July 1649), also commonly known as il Padovanino, was an Italian painter of the late-mannerist and early-baroque Venetian school, best known for having mentored Pietro Liberi, Giulio Carpioni, and Bartolommeo Scaligero.[1] He was theson of Dario Varotari the Elder and the brother of Chiara Varotari, who accompanied him on his travels and assisted with his work.[2]

Born in Padua, hence his nickname, he was the son of the local painter and architect Dario Varotari the Elder, who likely provided his earliest training. Early paintings, such as The incredulity of St. Thomas,[3] Virgin and Child,[4] and the Pentecost[5] show the influence of Titian. By the year 1614 he had relocated to Venice. He is known to have traveled to Rome twice (mid-1610s and 1625), where he was much employed in producing copies of major paintings from major Renaissance artists of the prior generation.[6] He painted a major battle canvas in The victory of the Carnutesi (Celts) over the Normans’’[7]
