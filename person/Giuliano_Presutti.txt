#Introduction#
Giuliano Presutti or Persciutti or Presciutti (active, Fano, 1490 - Ancona, 1554) was an Italian painter of the Renaissance period, active in Marche and Umbria.

He was either a follower of Antonio Solario or Vittore Crivelli, although he was also strongly influenced by the Early Renaissance school of Umbria, including Perugino, Giovanni Santi and Timoteo Viti. Presutti is reported to have completed a Glory of Mary Magdalen (1523), started by Viti, for the Cathedral of Gubbio. He painted an altarpiece of Comunione degli Apostoli(circa 1538-1546) in San Domenico in Gubbio. An Immaculate Conception at Cagli is attributed to Presutti.[1]
