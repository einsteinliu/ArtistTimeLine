#Introduction#
Michelangelo Aliprandi (1527–1595) was an Italian painter from Verona, who flourished from about 1560 to 1582.

He was an imitator, if not a pupil, of Paolo Veronese, in whose style he painted an altar-piece — the Madonna and Child between St. Roch and St. Sebastian — in the church of SS. Nazaro e Celso in Verona, where it is still preserved. Many of the works which Aliprandi painted in and around his native city are however lost.[1]

His drawing of Virgin and Child crowned by the angels, with St. Sebastian and St. Rock is in the Louvre.[2]
