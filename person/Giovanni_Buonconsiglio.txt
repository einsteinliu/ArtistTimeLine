#Introduction#
Giovanni Buonconsiglio (born Montecchio Maggiore c. 1465, died 1535 or 1537; active during 1497â€“1514) was an Italian painter of the Renaissance period, active mainly in Venice and his native Vicenza. Alternate names: Bonconsigli, Giovanni; Il Marescalco; Marescalco Buonconsiglio; Il Marescalco.

Buonconsiglio was probably apprenticed in Vicenza to Bartolomeo Montagna by 1484.[1] He painted in the style of Giovanni Bellini, but afterwards became a pupil of Antonello da Messina.

In Vicenza, he painted a Pieta for the church of San Bartolomeo (now in the Musei Civici Vicenza), a Virgin and child with saints for Oratorio de Turchini. He was living as late as 1530 at Venice, for the churches of which city he painted numerous altar-pieces, many of which have unfortunately perished. Among his works are: Virgin and Child (1511) for the Montagnana Cathedral; a St. Catharine (1513) in Louvre; Portrait of a Woman; Madonna with six Saints (Venice, Gallerie dell'Accademia). Fragments exist of a work in oil for SS. Cosmo e Damiano alla Giudecca representing SS. Benedict, Tecla, and Cosmo (1407); a Virgin and Saints mourning over the dead body of Christ; and Virgin and Child, with Saints Tempera (painted for San Bartolomeo in 1502).
