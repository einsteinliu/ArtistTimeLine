#Introduction#
Andrea Sabbatini (1487â€“1530) (var. Andrea Sabatini or Andrea da Salerno) was an Italian painter of the Renaissance, born in Salerno, and one of the best disciples of Raphael.

Andrea da Salerno created a number of important paintings with religious motives, such as The Adoring of the Cross, The Seven Church Teachers, Saint Nicholas in a Throne Between his Saviors, Offering of the Kings, Madonna with Boy, etc., which are displayed in the Museum of Naples. He also produced frescoes in churches, such as in Santa Maria delle Grazie, San Gennaro dei Poveri, and others.

It is said that Andrea da Salerno was Raphael's disciple, and absorbed most of his style. This is particularly evident in one of his last works, Nativity.
