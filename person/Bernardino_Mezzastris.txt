#Introduction#
Bernardino (or Belardino) Mezzastris (or Mezastris) (fl. 1st half of the 16th century), Italian painter of the Umbrian school, probably from Foligno in Umbria. He was a minor artist: some of his frescoes on religious subjects survive, but garner little critical acclaim. He should not be confused with the much more important Pier Antonio Mezzastris, who was likely a relative, possibly his father.

Works by Bernardino Mezzastris include:
