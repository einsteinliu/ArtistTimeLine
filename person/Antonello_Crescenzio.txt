#Introduction#
Antonello Crescenzio, known as Antonello da Palermo, who, according to De Marzo, was the son of Antonio Crescenzio, was born early in the 16th century, and practised both as a sculptor and a painter. He was an assistant to the sculptor Gagnino in 1527. In 1537 he completed two copies of Raphael's 'Spasimo;' one of them is in the Carmelite Church at Palermo, and the other in the Monastery of Fazello, near Sciacca. The date of his death is uncertain.
