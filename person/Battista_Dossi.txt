#Introduction#
Battista Dossi (ca. 1490–1548), also known as Battista de Luteri, was an Italian painter who belonged to the Ferrara School of Painting. He spent nearly his entire career in service of the Court of Ferrara, where he worked with his older brother Dosso Dossi (c. 1489-1542). It is believed that Battista worked in the Rome studio of Raphael from 1517 to 1520. Battista’s students include Camillo Filippi (c. 1500-1574).
