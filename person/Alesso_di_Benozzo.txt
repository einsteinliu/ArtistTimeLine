He is mainly known for works, along with his brothers Gerolamo and Francesco,they completed in collaboration with their father. He painted an Annunciation now in New York.[1] He is different from the contemporary painter Alesso Baldovinetti. Bennozo himself is sometimes called Benozzo di Lese (Alesso) after his father Lese.
