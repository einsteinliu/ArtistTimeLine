#Introduction#
Carlo Antonio Procaccini (born 1555) was an Italian painter of the late-Renaissance period.

He was the third son of Ercole, the brother of Camillo and Giulio Cesare the elder, and father of Ercole Procaccini the Younger (1605â€“1675). He was born at Bologna and initially trained by his father, though he excelled in painting landscapes and still-lifes with flowers and fruit, mainly in Milan.
