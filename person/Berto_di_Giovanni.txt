#Introduction#
Berto di Giovanni (di Marco), a pupil of Perugino, painted at Perugia from 1497 to 1525. He executed works for the magistrates, and was a member of the guild of that city. He painted with a predella, in the convent of Santa Maria di Monteluce at Perugia, the following subjects from the Life of Christ: 'The Nativity,' 'The Presentation,' and 'The Marriage' and 'Death of the Virgin.' These form part of a large work of the 'Coronation of the Virgin,' which Raphael was originally commissioned to paint, but which was subsequently executed by an artist whose name has not been recorded.
