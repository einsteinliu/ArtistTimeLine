He painted an Adoration by the shepherds (1567) originally in the church of the confraternity of Santa Maria dell’Angelo, but now in the pinacoteca of Faenza.[1] He also painted along with Giorgio Vasari a series of frescoes in the Palazzo Vecchio representing the Life of Hercules.[2] He painted an altarpiece representing the Martyrdom of St. Catherine of Alexandria (1580) in the church of San Antonio in Faenza.
