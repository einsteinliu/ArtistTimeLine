#Introduction#
Francesco Rustici (1600â€“1625) was an Italian painter of the Baroque period. He was also known as Il Rustichino. He was initially a pupil of his father Cristoforo Rustici, then became a follower of the style of Caravaggio. Francesco painted an Annunciation for the church of the Madonna di Provenzano in Siena. He painted a Death of Mary Magdalen for a Medici patron, and St. Sebastian for Palazzo Borghese. Francesco should not be confused with the earlier Renaissance painter of Florence, Giovanni Francesco Rustici.
