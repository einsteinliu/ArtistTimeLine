#Introduction#
Biagio Betti (1535â€“1605) was an Italian painter of the Renaissance period. He was born in Cutigliano, and was a pupil of Daniele da Volterra. He became, in 1557, a monk of the order of the Theatines of San Silvestro al Quirinale, and his works are principally confined to the monastery of that order in Rome. In the refectory he painted the Miracle of the Loaves and Fishes which was restored by Paolo Anesi in 1847; and in the library, Christ disputing with the Doctors.
