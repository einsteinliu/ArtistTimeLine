#Introduction#
Quirizio di Giovanni da Murano or Quirizio da Murano or Quiricius (Venice floriat circa 1460 to 1478), was an Italian Renaissance painter of religious subjects.

Little is known about this painter. He is supposed to have been a pupil of Antonio of Murano, though conjectures by critics vary about him and his work.

The probability is that he did little alone, but was one of the assistants in the Vivarini workshop.

His use of tempera is similar to the school of Murano, flat, light, and with little or no shade. His type of head is regular and well-shaped, fingers and neck long, waist very slender.

Some of other works attributed to him may have been done by Bartolommeo Vivarini.
