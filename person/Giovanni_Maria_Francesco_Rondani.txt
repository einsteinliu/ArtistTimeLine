#Introduction#
Giovanni Maria Francesco Rondani (July 1490 â€“ September 1550) was an Italian painter of the Parmesan school of painting. He was a near contemporary of Michelangelo Anselmi, and is known to have worked on designs of Antonio da Correggio for the frescoes (1522) in the Cappella del Bono of San Giovanni Evangelista of Parma, Italy. Rondani worked with Anselmi in the Oratorio della Concezione of the church. He also painted scenes of Christ's Passion and of the Life of St. Anthony Abbot in Capella Centoni in Parma.
