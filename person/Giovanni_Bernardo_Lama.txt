#Introduction#
Giovanni Bernardo Lama (1508–1579) was an Italian painter of the Renaissance period, active mainly in Naples. He was the son of a generally unknown artist, Matteo Lama. He was the apprentice of Giovanni Antonio D’Amato, then Polidoro da Caravaggio who had fled Rome after the Sack of 1527. He worked in the style of his friend and contemporary Andrea di Salerno. A Madonna and child with saints is in the sacristy of San Luca Evangelista in Praiano. A Deposition from the Cross is found in the Royal Pontifical Basilica of San Giacomo Spagnoli in Naples.

Note: He should not be confused with a fellow Neapolitan painter of subsequent generations, Giovanni Battista Lama (born 1660).
