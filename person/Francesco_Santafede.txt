#Introduction#
Francesco Santafede (16th century) was an Italian painter of the Renaissance period, active mainly in Naples. He was the father of the painter Fabrizio Santafede, a pupil of Andrea Sabbatini. He was a colleague of Francesco Imparato, and like his son, emerged from the studio of Andrea Sabbatini (Andrea di Salerno), although he appears to have also followed the style of Perugino and Giovanni Filippo Criscuolo.[1]
