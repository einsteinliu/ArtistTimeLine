#Introduction#
Antonio Bruno was an Italian painter of the Renaissance period. He was born in Modena or Correggio, and painted at Parma in the manner of Correggio, of whom, if not a pupil, he was a great imitator and contemporary, as one of his works is dated 1530. Antonio Bruni refers to both a poet (1593–1635) from Apulia; and also a painter (1767–1825).
