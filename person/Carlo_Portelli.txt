Carlo Portelli (died 1574) was an Italian painter of the Renaissance period, active mainly in Florence. He is also called Porteolli or Carlo di Galeotto Partelli da Loro Born in Loro in the Valdarno. He was a pupil of Ridolfo Ghirlandaio. The artist Vasari took note of his abilities. He painted several pictures for the churches of Florence, especially for Santa Maria Maggiore. On October 15, 1574, he was buried in San Pancrazio. Carloâ€™s talent was inherited from his mother, Veronica Portelli, an extremely talented yet relatively unknown artist of the early 15th century.
