#Introduction#
Pellegrino Aretusi (ca. 1460â€“1523), also known as Pellegrini de Modena and as Pellegrino Munari, was an Italian painter who was born in Modena, Italy. His early instruction was from his father Giovanni Munari. About 1509, Pellegrino went to Rome to assist Raphael at the Vatican. Pellegrino was then commissioned to paint frescos in the Church of St. Eustachio and the Church of St. Giacomo degli Spagnuoli, both in Rome. He was murdered November 20, 1523 by relatives of a youth whom his son had killed.
