#Introduction#
Bernardino Campi (1522â€“1591) was an Italian Renaissance painter from Reggio Emilia, who worked in Cremona. He is known as one of the teachers of Sofonisba Anguissola and of Giovanni Battista Trotti (il Malosso). In Cremona, his extended family were the main artistic studios. Giulio Campi and Antonio Campi, half-brothers, were distant relatives of Bernardino; the latter is generally considered the most talented of the family. All were active and prominent painters locally. Influences on Bernardino's are likely diverse, including those from local Cremonese such as Camillo Boccaccino, to artists from neighboring regions such as Correggio, Parmigianino and Giulio Romano.

Among his pupils were Giovanni Antonio Morandi (active 1585) and Pietro Martire Pesenti, both active in the Palazzo of Guastalla.[1]
