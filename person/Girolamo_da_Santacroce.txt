#Introduction#
Girolamo da Santacroce (c. 1480/85 – c. 1556) was a 16th-century Italian painter of the Renaissance period, active mainly in Venice and the Venetian mainland. He was a pupil of the painter Gentile Bellini. After Gentile's death, Santacroce most likely worked as an assistant to another Venetian painter, Giovanni Bellini.

Girolamo da Santacroce should not be confused with Girolamo Santacroce (c. 1502 – c. 1537), the Neapolitan sculptor.
