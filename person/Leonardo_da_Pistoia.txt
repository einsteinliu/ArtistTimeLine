#Introduction#
Leonardo Grazia or Leonardo da Pistoia (1502 - ca. 1548) was an Italian painter of the Renaissance period. Born in Pistoia in Tuscany, he died in Naples. Pistoia worked early on in Rome, and moved to Naples to work under Gianfrancesco Penni, also known as il Fattore. According to Bénézit, Grazia is often confused with Leonardo di Francesco di Lazzaro Malatesta (ca 1483 - after 1518), as both were known as "Leonardo da Pistoia".
