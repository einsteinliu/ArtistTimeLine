#Introduction#
Benedetto Nucci (Cagli, 1515-1587) was an Italian painter of the late-Renaissance or Mannerism period.

He was a pupil of Pietro Paolo Baldinacci in Gubbio, province of Umbria. Benedetto married his master's daughter, Orsolina, in 1549. He did not train with Raffaellino dal Colle, as reported, but was highly influenced by Raphael. He painted a ‘’Madonna and Child with Saints’’ (1570) for the Cathedral in Gubbio.[1]

Among his pupils were his son (or brother)[2] Virgilio (trained also in Rome with Daniele da Volterra, and died in Gubbio in 1621); Mario Marioni; Giovanni Maria Baldassini (active 1540-1601, and who painted the Madonna of the Rosary in San Nicolo di Cantiano); Bernardino Brozzi (1555-1617, who has works in Sant'Agostino, Gubbio); and the prominent painter of Gubbio, Felice Damiani.[3]
