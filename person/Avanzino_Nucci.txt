#Introduction#
Avanzino Nucci (c. 1552–1629) was an Italian painter of the late-Renaissance period.

He was born in Città di Castello and died in Rome. He trained with Niccolò Circignani (il Pomarancio). Bernardino Gagliardi was one of his pupils. His paintings can be found in the Roman churches of San Rocco all'Augusteo, San Silvestro al Quirinale, and San Paolo fuora le Mura. Some more paintings dated 1596 are in the parlour of the ex Charthusian Monastery and now museum of S. Martino in Naples. They represent the foundation of the Carthusian order by S. Brunon of Cologne (Germany),the approval of the order by the Pope Urban II and the meeting of the Saint with the Norman king of southern Italy Roger.
