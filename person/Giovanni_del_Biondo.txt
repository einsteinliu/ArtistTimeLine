#Introduction#
Giovanni del Biondo was a 14th-century Italian painter of the Gothic and early-Renaissance period, active 1356-1399.

From tax records it is known that Giovanni del Biondo lived and flourished in Florence until his death. He specialized in religious-themed works, many of which have survived.[1] The central panel of a triptych of his at the Ospedale degli Innocenti in Florence shows the Annunciation with Saint Nicholas and Anthony the Great in the left and right wings. There is a devotional painting by this late medieval painter in the Memorial Art Gallery in Rochester, New York. He also has two devotional paintings in the Art Gallery of Ontario Saint Benedict Restoring Sight to Blind Monk and Vision of Saint Benedict.
