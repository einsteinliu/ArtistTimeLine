#Introduction#
Orazio Vecellio (c. 1528-1576) was an Italian painter of the Renaissance period. the son and pupil of Titian, was born at Venice about 1528. He distinguished himself as a painter of portraits, some of which were thought little inferior to those of his father. He occasionally painted historical subjects; one of the most important was destroyed in the conflagration in the ducal palace at Venice. He neglected painting, however, to devote himself to alchemy, and died of the plague at Venice, in the same year with his father.
