#Introduction#
Marco Basaiti (c. 1470 – 1530) was a Venetian painter and a rival of Giovanni Bellini. His best known works are Christ Praying in the Garden (1516) and the Calling of St. Peter and St. Andrew.

Marco Basaiti was born in 1470.[1] in either Venice[2][3] or Friuli[4][5] His family was of either Greek origin, as Vasari reported,[6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14] or possibly Albanian.[15][16][17][18]

He began to paint actively from 1496 to 1520[19] and is generally believed to have learned to paint in the workshops of Alvise Vivarini. Basaiti resided for a long while at Venice, where there are many of his works, and he is quoted as a rival of Giovanni Bellini and that he surpassed him in some points.[20] He worked primarily with religious themes, but he also did portraits. Contrary to the trends of the time, he used very bright colours in rendering his religious subjects.

The artist is known for his compositions and combining the grounds with figures.[20] The 1999 restoration and conservation of the Basaiti's oevre in the Museum of King Jan III's Palace at Wilanów in Warsaw revealed bright colours[21] and an effigy of artist's sponsor, Alvise di Franceschi, as Saint Liberalis.
