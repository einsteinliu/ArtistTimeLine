#Introduction#
Francesco Morone (1471 â€“ 16 May 1529) was an Italian painter, active in his native city of Verona in a Renaissance style. He was the son of the Veronese painter Domenico Morone.[1] The art biographer Vasari praised his frescoes (1505-7) for the cupola of the sacristy in Santa Maria in Organo, Verona. He also painted the organ shutters in that church. Paolo Cavazzola was said to have been a pupil, but may have more aptly worked with one of his family members.[2]
