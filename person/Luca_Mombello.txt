#Introduction#
Luca Mombello (late 16th century) was an Italian painter of the late-Renaissance periods, mainly active in Brescia.

He was the pupil of il Moretto, and respected for painting altarpieces in the Duomo Vecchio including one of the Virgin and Child with Saints Cecilia and Catherine. However he was expelled from the studio for "lubricious sins" (peccando singolarmente per piacere ad imbelli ed indotte persone di troppa lisciatura ).
