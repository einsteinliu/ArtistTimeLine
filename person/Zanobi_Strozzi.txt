#Introduction#
Zanobi Strozzi (Florence , 17 November 1412 - 6 December 1468) was an Italian painter and miniaturist. He was one of the top pupils of Fra Angelico.

Zanobi belonged to the important Florentine Strozzi family. From 1434 to 1439 he painted a panel for the partition of the Sant'Egidio, Rome, probably the Madonna and Child with Four Angels' today at the Museum of San Marco in Florence. In 1438, he married Nanna francesco Strozzi and moved into a new house always Fiesole. Around 1440 he completed his only painting signed 'Annunciation' in San Miniato al Monte, now in the National Gallery in London. Vasari, in the biography of Fra Angelico, named him one of the most loyal followers of the Dominican friar, who had probably met him in the thirties at San Domenico. He also collaborated with Francesco Pesellino and Domenico di Michelino. As a miniaturist, he was responsible for development of several choirs for the church of San Marco , carried out between 1446 and 1454.

Around 1460 the Medici commissioned him an altarpiece for the church of San Girolamo in Fiesole, they sponsored for its proximity to their villa . The work is now in the Mus√©e du Petit Palais, Avignon. In 1463 he was in charge of illuminating the choir of the Cathedral of Florence, now in the bottom of Construction Laurentian Library (Nos. 149, 150, 151), in collaboration with Francesco di Antonio del Clerico.
