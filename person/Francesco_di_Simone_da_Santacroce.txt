Francesco di Simone da Santacroce or Santa Croce (born in Santa Croce, frazione of San Pellegrino Terme, near Bergamo circa 1470-1475 and died Venice, 1508) was an Italian painter, active mainly in a Renaissance style. He was influenced by Giovanni Bellini.

He is best known for founding a studio that that trained Francesco Rizzo, who inherited the studio after his masterâ€™s demise, and later Palma il Vecchio and Andrea Previtali. His main pupil Francesco Rizzo is also sometimes known as Francesco da Santacroce. [1] To confuse names further, a Francesco di Simone, was putatively active in the early 15th century in Naples, a pupil of Simone Napoletano and colleague of Colantonio del Fiore.[2] Finally Simone Ferrucci is a Quattrocento sculptor also known as Francesco di Simone Ferrucci.
