#Introduction#
Lazzaro Bastiani (1429 â€“ 5 April 1512) was an Italian painter of the Renaissance, active mainly in Venice.

He was born in Padua. He is first recorded as a painter in Venice by 1460 in a payment for an altarpiece of San Samuele, for the Procuratori di San Marco. In 1462 he was paid at the same rate as Giovanni Bellini. In 1470, he was a member of the Scuola di San Girolamo in Venice. In the 1480s he worked with Gentile Bellini for the Scuola Grande di San Marco. He painted a Coronation of the Virgin (Gallerie dell'Accademia); a Nativity (1477); and a St. Anthony on the Nut Tree.

In 1508 he was called upon, with his pupil Vittore Carpaccio, to estimate paintings of Giorgione for the Fondaco dei Tedeschi.
