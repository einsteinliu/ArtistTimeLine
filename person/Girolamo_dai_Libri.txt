#Introduction#
Girolamo dai Libri (1474/1475 â€“ July 2, 1555) was an Italian illuminator of manuscripts and painter of altarpieces, working in an early-Renaissance style.

He was born and mainly active in Verona. His father was Francesco dai Libri, and was so named because he was an illuminator of books. Girolamo's works were noted by Giorgio Vasari. Girolamo was a pupil of Domenico Morone.[1] Dai Libri painted his first altarpiece, a Deposition from the Cross for Santa Maria in Organo in Verona, at the age of sixteen. His other works included the Adoration of Child, Vergine tra i santi Tomasso e Agostino and the Holy Family at San Paolo (Saint Paul's) Church in the same city.
